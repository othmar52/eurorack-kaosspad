# eurorack-kaosspad
mod of KORG mini kaoss pad 2 for use within eurorack


inspired by [millionmachinemarch](https://millionmachinemarch.com/index.php/tag/mini-kaoss-pad-2-mod/)  
this is another approach to modify the [KORG mini kaoss pad 2](https://www.korg.com/de/products/dj/mini_kaoss_pad2/index.php) having it as an eurorack mudule.  

## TODO
  - Convert Voltage from 12V eurorack power bus to 4.5V
  - Convert eurorack level to line level for input and add 2 pots for attenuating audio input levels
  - Convert line level to eurorack level for output and add 2 pots for attenuating audio output levels
  - Remove housing of the kaoss pad and mount it to a frontpanel
  - Create a 2nd frontpanel as a breakout for the main module with all extracted controls and connectors
